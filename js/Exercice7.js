// Strings and Functions
// Write a program that asks the user for a word. It then displays the following:
//  Number of vowels in the word (a, e, i, o, u, and y)
//  Whether your word is a palindrome or not
// o A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same way both forward and
// backwards (e.g. radar, level, madam)
// Examples:
// Input: Madam
// Output: Madam contains 2 vowels and is a palindrome
// Input: JavaScript
// Output: JavaScript contains 3 vowels and is not a palindrome
// Notes / Requirements:
// a. Create two functions per the following.
// There are many solutions to this exercise. I want to make sure you know how to work
// with "black box" functions. Given an input, the function returns an output. The user is
// not concerned with the details of how the output is calculated or the function displaying
// output in a specific format. The user gets the returned value and uses it as needed.
// i. First function - Compute number of vowels. Use the following:
// Input: Word (given above)
// Return: Number of vowels
// ii. Second function - Determine if the word is a palindrome. Use the following:
// Input: Word (given above)
// Return (a Boolean): True/False or 0/1
// b. Program is case insensitive
