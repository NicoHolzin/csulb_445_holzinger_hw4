// Guess a Number
// Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, inclusive.
// It then prompts the user to guess the number (assume valid entry).
// The program will provide the following feedback after each guess:
//  Too low, guess again
//  Too high, guess again
//  Correct
// If correct, also display how many attempts it took. For example:
// Correct! It took you 7 attempts to guess the correct number.
